static scope: go through static links until you get to the
    place where something was defined, compiler knows how far to go

dynamic scope: follow the dynamic link but the compiler doesn't know how many times

static scope won for some reason
this is why:

val pi = 3.1415
def areaofcircle(r):
    return pi*r*r // this pi is 3.1415

def crust(pi):
    return pi*areaofcircle(5)

calling crust(100) should return (and it does with static scope):
    100 * 3.1415 * r*r
with dynamic scope, it returns:
    100 * 100 * r * r

this could be avoided by just using a better name, but its not a problem with static scope
